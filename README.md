# Bitcoin Price Analysis and Prediction
This project involves the analysis and prediction of Bitcoin prices using historical transactional data. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series forecasting, principal component analysis (PCA), clustering analysis, and price prediction using machine learning algorithms.
## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

- To analyze historical Bitcoin price data and identify trends.
- To forecast future Bitcoin prices using time series analysis.
- To understand the underlying patterns in Bitcoin transactional data using PCA and clustering.
- To predict Bitcoin prices using machine learning regression models.
## Libraries Used

The project was implemented using Python and several Python libraries,

1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Statsmodels
6. Scikit-learn

## ðŸ”— Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is a CSV file containing historical Bitcoin price data, taken from kaggle website. 

**The dataset includes the following columns:**
1. Date: The date of the transaction.
2. Open: The opening price of Bitcoin.
3. High: The highest price of Bitcoin during the day.
4. Low: The lowest price of Bitcoin during the day.
5. Close: The closing price of Bitcoin.
6. Adj Close: The adjusted closing price of Bitcoin.
7. Volume: The volume of Bitcoin traded on the given day.
## Analysis Overview
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset and handling missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing trends and patterns in Bitcoin prices over time.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Using ARIMA models to forecast future Bitcoin prices.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and visualizing clusters.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Identifying clusters of similar Bitcoin transaction patterns using K-means clustering.
- **Price Prediction:** Using machine learning regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network) to predict Bitcoin prices.
## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into Bitcoin price trends and transactional patterns. The analysis and prediction models can be used by investors and researchers to make informed decisions about Bitcoin investments.
